# Boss Room Barrier Setup Guide

## Overview
The boss room barrier system creates physical barriers around the boss room to prevent player access until all puzzles are solved. These barriers are actual GameObjects with colliders that block player movement.

## Features
- **Physical Barriers**: Creates actual wall GameObjects around the boss room
- **Dynamic Creation**: Barriers are created after dungeon generation if boss room is locked
- **Automatic Removal**: Barriers are destroyed when all puzzles are solved
- **Collision Detection**: Players cannot pass through the barriers

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Boss Room Barrier Prefab
Create a prefab for the boss room barrier with the following components:

#### Required Components:
- **SpriteRenderer**: Visual representation of the barrier
- **Collider2D**: Must be a solid collider (isTrigger = false) to block player movement
- **Rigidbody2D**: Set to Kinematic for proper collision detection

#### Required Settings:
- **Collider2D**: 
  - Set `isTrigger = false` (MUST be false for solid barriers)
  - Size should match the sprite size
- **Rigidbody2D**: 
  - Set `Body Type = Kinematic` (REQUIRED for proper collision)
  - Set `Simulated = true`
  - Set `Use Full Kinematic Contacts = true`
- **Layer**: Use a layer that can collide with the player layer

#### Visual Design:
- Use a distinct sprite that clearly indicates the barrier is impassable
- Consider using a different color or pattern than regular walls
- Make it visually clear that this is a temporary barrier

### 2. Configure DungeonGenerator
1. In the DungeonGenerator component, find the "Boss Room Barrier Prefabs" section
2. Assign your boss room barrier prefab to the `bossRoomBarrierPrefab` field
3. Ensure `enablePuzzleBossRoomLock` is set to `true`

### 3. Puzzle Manager Setup
1. Ensure the PuzzleManager is present in the scene
2. Verify that all puzzle objects implement the `IsPuzzleSolved()` method

## How It Works

### Barrier Creation
1. **After Dungeon Generation**: The system checks if the boss room should be locked
2. **Physical Barriers**: Creates actual GameObject barriers around the boss room perimeter
3. **Barrier Placement**: Barriers are placed 2 tiles away from the boss room edges
4. **Collision**: Players cannot move through the barrier GameObjects

### Barrier Removal
1. **Puzzle Completion**: When all puzzles are solved, the system detects completion
2. **Barrier Destruction**: All barrier GameObjects are destroyed
3. **Corridor Creation**: Corridors are created to connect the boss room
4. **Access Granted**: Players can now access the boss room

## Technical Details

### Barrier Placement Logic
```csharp
// Barriers are placed in a ring around the boss room
int barrierDistance = 2; // 2 tiles away from boss room

// Top and bottom barriers
for (int x = bossRoom.x - barrierDistance; x <= bossRoom.x + bossRoom.width + barrierDistance; x++)
{
    // Create barriers at top and bottom edges
}

// Left and right barriers  
for (int y = bossRoom.y - barrierDistance; y <= bossRoom.y + bossRoom.height + barrierDistance; y++)
{
    // Create barriers at left and right edges
}
```

### GameObject Management
- Barriers are stored in `bossRoomBarrierObjects` list
- Each barrier is instantiated as a child of `dungeonParent`
- Barriers are destroyed when puzzles are solved

## Troubleshooting

### Barriers Not Appearing
- Check that `bossRoomBarrierPrefab` is assigned in DungeonGenerator
- Verify that `enablePuzzleBossRoomLock` is enabled
- Ensure the boss room is actually locked (puzzles not solved)
- Check console for barrier creation logs

### Player Can Pass Through Barriers
- Verify the barrier prefab has a Collider2D component
- Check that `isTrigger` is set to `false` for solid barriers
- Ensure the player has a Rigidbody2D or Collider2D for collision detection
- Check that the barrier and player are on compatible layers

### Barriers Not Removing
- Verify that all puzzles are actually solved
- Check that PuzzleManager is finding all puzzle objects
- Look for console logs about puzzle completion
- Ensure `RemoveBossRoomBarriers()` is being called

### Performance Issues
- Consider using object pooling for barriers if creating many
- Limit the number of barriers created
- Use efficient collision detection methods

## Example Barrier Prefab Setup

### GameObject Hierarchy:
```
BossRoomBarrier (Prefab)
├── SpriteRenderer
├── BoxCollider2D
└── Rigidbody2D (Kinematic)
```

### Component Settings:
- **SpriteRenderer**: 
  - Assign barrier sprite
  - Order in Layer: Higher than floor tiles (e.g., 1)
- **BoxCollider2D**: 
  - Size: Match sprite size exactly
  - Is Trigger: false (CRITICAL)
  - Offset: (0, 0, 0)
- **Rigidbody2D**:
  - Body Type: Kinematic (CRITICAL)
  - Simulated: true
  - Use Full Kinematic Contacts: true
  - Interpolate: Interpolate

### Optional Components:
- **AudioSource**: For barrier sound effects
- **ParticleSystem**: For visual effects when barriers appear/disappear
- **Animator**: For animated barriers

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Minimap Integration
Barriers will appear on the minimap as wall tiles since they're placed on floor tiles.

### Enemy AI
Enemies will treat barriers as walls and navigate around them.

### Save System
Barrier state is not saved - barriers are recreated based on puzzle completion status.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Barrier Types
You can create different barrier prefabs for different areas or create animated barriers.

### Barrier Effects
Add particle effects, sounds, or animations when barriers appear or disappear.

### Conditional Barriers
Modify the barrier creation logic to create different barriers based on game state.
